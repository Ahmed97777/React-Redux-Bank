React-Redux-Bank, your go-to playground for exploring banking features in the world of React and Redux.

## Features

This repository demonstrates a simplified banking application with the following features:

- 💰 **Deposit**: Add funds to your account.
- 💸 **Withdraw**: Make withdrawals when needed.
- 💳 **Request Loan**: Ask for a loan when times are tough.
- ⏳ **Pay Loan**: Repay loans with ease.

## Tech Stack

This project was created using the classic Redux library to showcase the fundamental principles of state management, then the codebase got upgraded to take advantage of Redux Toolkit (RTK), offering a more modern and efficient approach to managing your application's state.

## Getting Started

Get hands-on experience with Redux the old way and then dive into the enhanced power of RTK for state management. Learn how to handle complex application states with ease.

**Note:** This project was created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of React. While I already had a foundation in React, Jonas Schmedtmann's online course on Udemy (The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More) played a pivotal role in expanding my knowledge and enhancing my skills.
